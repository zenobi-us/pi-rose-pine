## Next Steps

**Recommended:** Create new epic for Rose Pine Theme Implementation

**Suggested Epic Phases:**
1. **Phase 1: Architecture Planning** - Design theme structure, decide on @rose-pine/palette integration approach
2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - Implement all three variants with semantic color mapping
3. **Phase 3: CLI Integration** - Map theme to pi CLI output contexts (error, success, info, etc.)
4. **Phase 4: Testing & Refinement** - Test readability, color accuracy, terminal compatibility
5. **Phase 5: Documentation & Gallery** - Document usage, prepare for community submission

**Success Criteria for Implementation:**
- All three variants implemented
- Exact official hex values used
- Semantic color roles properly mapped
- Terminal ANSI colors correctly assigned
- Theme tested across different terminal environments
- Documentation includes proper Rose Pine attribution
- Ready for official gallery submission
