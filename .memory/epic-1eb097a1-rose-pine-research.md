# Epic: Rose Pine Theme Research

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Timeline:** January 2026
**Owner:** Session (Research Phase)
**Created:** 2026-01-17
**Completed:** 2026-01-17

## Vision

Conduct comprehensive research on the official Rose Pine colour themes to understand their design philosophy, colour palettes, variants, and usage guidelines. This research will inform the development of a pi-rose-pine theme implementation.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Document all official Rose Pine colour palettes with hex values
- [x] Identify and document all theme variants (main, moon, dawn, etc.)
- [x] Understand and document the design philosophy behind Rose Pine
- [x] Collect official usage guidelines and specifications
- [x] Find and document any official documentation sources
- [x] Create comprehensive knowledge base for theme implementation

## Phases

- [Phase 1: Initial Research](archive/phase-463106f1-initial-research.md) ✅

## Distilled Learnings

All research findings have been distilled into actionable implementation guidance:

- [Rose Pine Implementation Guide](learning-a7f3c2d9-rose-pine-implementation-guide.md) - Complete implementation knowledge with 10 critical learnings and implementation checklist

## Dependencies

- Internet access for research ✅
- Access to official Rose Pine documentation ✅
- Brave Search skill for web research ✅

## Outcomes

Successfully completed all research objectives:

1. ✅ **Complete Palette Documentation** - All three variants (main, moon, dawn) with 15 colors each documented with hex values
2. ✅ **Design Philosophy Captured** - Minimalist aesthetic, natural inspiration, semantic color roles understood
3. ✅ **Official Resources Identified** - Website, GitHub, npm package, template, build tool documented
4. ✅ **Implementation Path Clarified** - @rose-pine/palette package identified as preferred integration method
5. ✅ **Community Standards Understood** - 200+ ports analyzed, naming conventions and submission process documented

## Notes

This epic focused exclusively on gathering foundational knowledge about Rose Pine themes. With research complete and learnings distilled, the project is ready to proceed to implementation planning and execution in a new epic.

**Recommended Next Epic:** "Rose Pine Theme Implementation" - Design and build pi-rose-pine theme following the learnings captured in this research phase.
